# Cleaner Twitter UI
A browser extension that looks to remove some of the unnecessary elements on Twitter's web UI and resize its main window so that the screen looks cleaner.

It is Mozilla Firefox only and was thought and made for personal use, not tested on any other device but my PC.

## What was changed
- No more Grok and Follow buttons on the nav section;
- The whole right side bar with premium subscription begging, who to follow, what's happening and terms and condition was removed;
- Readjusts for centering the remaining content.

## To do
- Remove all Grok "explain this post" buttons on tweets.
